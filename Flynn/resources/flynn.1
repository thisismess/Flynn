.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
evaluates a series of input animation frame images and encodes them into a sequence of
specially-formatted output images which represent the animation in a (generally) more efficient
form.
.Pp
Flynn animations can be decoded and played in any modern Web browser by the Flynn player, a
Javascript library which you can obtain from
.Ar http://flynn.thisismess.com/ .
.Sh USAGE
The
.Nm
encoder can be invoked in two ways:
.Pp
If
.Ar exactly one
input file argument is provided, that file is assumed to be a directory full of images.
.Nm
will traverse the directory non-recursively and encode each image it encounters as a frame in the
output animation. The images are encoded in lexical order based on their filename. As such, you
should name your frame images with some kind of numerical suffix, e.g.:
.Ar frame_001.png ,
.Ar frame_002.png ,
and so fourth.
.Pp
If
.Ar more than one
input file argument is provided, those files are assumed to be individual frame images.
.Nm
will encode each of the image files provided as arguments as a frame in the output animation. The images
are encoded in the order they are provided on the command line. If you provide frame images in this
way their filenames are not significant to the encoder.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are supported by
.Nm
for encoding:
.Bl -tag -width -indent  \" Differs from above in tag removed 
.It Fl n -name Ar name
The name of the animation. This name is used as the base name for output files (e.g., the
.Ar name
\'hello' might produce files 'hello_manifest.json', 'hello_keyframe.png', 'hello_001.png',
and so fourth). The default name for animations is 'flynn'.
.It Fl o -output Ar path
Output encoded animation files under the directory
.Ar path .
The directory at
.Ar path
will be created if it does not already exist.
.It Fl b -block-size Ar size
Use the dimesion
.Ar size
as the block size for the animation. Blocks are square and
.Ar size
is used for both dimensions (e.g., a
.Ar size
of 8 means 8x8 pixels). You can use any block size you like
provided that:
(1) the width and height of individual animation frames are a multiple of
.Ar size ,
and
(2) 
.Ar size
is both greater than 1 and less than the image size (
.Fl I -image-size
). By default
.Ar size
is 8.
.It Fl t -block-threshold Ar count
Use the block error threshold
.Ar count
when determining differences between frames. The error threshold refers to the maximum number of pixels which may
differ between frames in a single block before the entire block is updated. A threshold of 1 means a single pixel
difference between two frames causes that pixel's block to be updated; a threshold of 10 means 10 pixels must differ
before the block is updated. The default threshold
.Ar count
is 1.
.It Fl I -image-size Ar size
Use the dimension
.Ar size
as the image size of encoded block-stream images. Block-stream images are square and
.Ar size
is used for both dimensions (e.g., a
.Ar size
of 1624 means 1624x1624 pixels). You can use any
.Ar size
you like provided that it is a multiple of the block size (
.Fl b -block-size
). The default
.Ar size
is 1624, which is almost certainly what you want. 1624 is the maximum image dimension permitted by iOS devices.
.It Fl f -format Ar format
Use the specified image
.Ar format
for encoded block-stream images. By default PNG images are generated, but JPEG images are also supported and may
be preferable for animations that do not require transparency. The
.Ar format
is specified as a file extension. Use
.Ar png
to encode PNG images or
.Ar jpeg
to encode JPEG images.
.It Fl v -verbose
Display more information about the conversion process.
